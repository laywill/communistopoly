# How to Play Communistopoly

**"Have you played a board game before? You have. Very bourgeoisie of you, though helpful just this once!"**

This is a quick start guide covering the essentials to get you playing. For comprehensive rules, see the [complete rulebook](communistopoly-rules.md).

---

## What You Need

- **3-6 players** (one will be Stalin)
- **A shared screen** (hot-seat game)
- **About 60-90 minutes** to play

---

## Setup

### 1. Choose Stalin

One player must be Stalin. Stalin doesn't play as a regular player—they control the game, judge tribunals, and manage the State.

See the [complete rules](communistopoly-rules.md#selecting-stalin) for advice on selecting who will be first among equals.

### 2. Choose Your Piece

Each player selects a unique game piece. Each piece has special abilities and restrictions. Choose wisely!

See the [complete rules](communistopoly-rules.md#player-pieces-and-abilities) for all piece abilities.

### 3. Starting Resources

- Each player starts with **₽1,500**
- Everyone begins with a given **Party Rank**
- All properties start owned by **The State**

---

## Basic Gameplay

Play is taken in turns by players.

As Premier, Stalin does not take a turn and can use his powers at any time.
The game calls upon Stalin to make executive decisions at various points.

Do not upset Stalin.

### Your Turn

On your turn:

1. **Roll the dice** and move your piece clockwise
2. **Resolve the space** you land on:
   - **Property**: Purchase custodianship (if unclaimed and your rank allows) or pay quota to the custodian
   - **Railway/Utility**: Same as properties
   - **Party Directive**: Draw a card and follow instructions
   - **Communist Test**: Answer a question correctly for rewards
   - **Corner spaces**: See special spaces below
3. **Post-roll actions** (optional):
   - Improve properties with collectivization
   - Trade with other players
   - Denounce another player (once per round)
4. **End your turn** - next player goes

### Spaces

Spaces broadly are either a property, or a space that triggers some sort of event.

See the [complete rules](communistopoly-rules.md#the-board) for full details.

## Properties and Quotas

### Becoming a Custodian

When you land on an unclaimed property and can afford it, you may be able to purchase custodianship from the State.

### Paying Quotas (Rent)

When you land on someone else's property, you must pay them a quota based on:
- The property's base quota
- Whether they own the full group (2× multiplier)
- The collectivization level (4× to 30× multiplier)

See the [Property Quick Reference](property-reference.md) for all quota values.

### Collectivization (Improvements)

Once you own all properties in a group, you can improve them with collectivization levels (★☆☆☆☆ through ★★★★★).

Each level costs ₽100 (except People's Palace which costs ₽200) and dramatically increases quotas.

## The Party Rank System

Your rank determines what you can own and how vulnerable you are:

| Rank           | Can Own              | Denouncement Witnesses Needed | Special                    |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Proletariat**    | Work Camps only      | 0 witnesses                   | Easily denounced           |
| **Party Member**   | Up to Industrial     | 1 witness                     | Can denounce once per round |
| **Commissar**      | Anything + Utilities | 2 witnesses                   | Multiple denouncements     |
| **Inner Circle**   | Anything             | Unanimous + Stalin approval   | Nearly untouchable         |

**Advancing rank**:
- Pass Communist Tests successfully
- Stalin can promote/demote anyone
- Certain card effects
- Owning property groups

See the [complete rules](communistopoly-rules.md#party-rank-system) for full details.

## Denouncement and Tribunals

### How to Denounce

Once per round (more if Commissar+), you can denounce another player for crimes against the State.

1. Announce the accusation and crime
2. Gather required witnesses based on their rank
3. The accused may defend themselves
4. Stalin judges the tribunal
5. If guilty: Gulag, property confiscation, demotion, or worse

**Popular crimes**:
- Counter-revolutionary activities
- Capitalist sympathies
- Hoarding resources
- "You know what you did"

### Stalin's Role

Stalin has absolute power:
- Final say in all tribunals
- Can promote or demote any player
- Can send anyone to Gulag
- Can execute players
- Accepts (or rejects) bribes

Be nice to Stalin!

## Winning the Game

### Victory Conditions

- **Survivor Victory**: Be the last player standing (not eliminated or in permanent Gulag)
- **Stalin Victory**: All players are eliminated
- **Unanimous End**: All players vote to end the game (rare!)

### How Players Are Eliminated

- 10 turns in the Gulag
- Execution by Stalin
- Two failed Communist Tests in a row
- Defaulting on debts with no assets

---

## Quick Tips for New Players

1. **Don't ignore rank**: Advancing to Party Member early opens up better properties
2. **Stalin is king**: Flattery and bribes go a long way
3. **Watch your rubles**: Going broke and into Gulag is a death spiral
4. **Property groups matter**: Owning a full group doubles rent before collectivization
5. **Denounce strategically**: Use it to eliminate threats or settle scores
6. **Read your piece card**: Your special ability can be game-changing
7. **Communist Tests**: Study up! Wrong answers hurt
8. **Trading is powerful**: Make deals, form alliances, then betray them
9. **The Gulag is dangerous**: Don't let turns pile up—escape quickly!
10. **Nothing is fair**: This is Communistopoly, after all

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I trade anything?**
A: Yes! Properties, money, and favours can all be traded. Stalin must approve property trades.

**Q: What if I run out of money?**
A: You can mortgage properties, trade assets, or bribe Stalin. If you can't pay and have no assets, you may be eliminated.

**Q: Can Stalin be denounced?**
A: No. Denouncing Stalin is itself a crime!

**Q: How do Communist Tests work?**
A: You answer a question about communist history/ideology. Correct = ₽100 and possible rank up. Wrong = consequences. Two wrong in a row = elimination.

**Q: Can I refuse to buy a property?**
A: Yes, you can decline any property purchase.

**Q: What happens if I roll doubles?**
A: Take another turn! But three doubles sends you to Gulag for counter-revolutionary behavior.
