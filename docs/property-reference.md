## Collectivization Levels

Properties can be improved through collectivization (similar to houses/hotels in Monopoly). Each collectivization level dramatically increases the quota (rent) owed when other players land on your property.

**Collectivization Levels:**

- **None** (Site Only): Base quota × 1.0
- **Group Owned**: Base quota × 2.0 (when you own all properties in a group)
- **★☆☆☆☆** (Worker's Committee): Base quota × 4.0 (costs ₽100)
- **★★☆☆☆** (Party Oversight): Base quota × 9.0 (costs ₽100)
- **★★★☆☆** (Full Collectivization): Base quota × 15.0 (costs ₽100)
- **★★★★☆** (Model Soviet): Base quota × 20.0 (costs ₽100)
- **★★★★★** (People's Palace): Base quota × 30.0 (costs ₽200)

**Important**: You must own all properties in a group before you can begin collectivization.

## Railways (Trans-Siberian Railway Stations)

Railways cannot be collectivized. Their quota increases based on how many railways the custodian owns.

| Property            | Cost | Mortgage | Rent (1 owned) | Rent (2 owned) | Rent (3 owned) | Rent (4 owned) |
|---------------------|------|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Moscow Station      | ₽200 | ₽100     | ₽25            | ₽50            | ₽100           | ₽200           |
| Novosibirsk Station | ₽200 | ₽100     | ₽25            | ₽50            | ₽100           | ₽200           |
| Irkutsk Station     | ₽200 | ₽100     | ₽25            | ₽50            | ₽100           | ₽200           |
| Vladivostok Station | ₽200 | ₽100     | ₽25            | ₽50            | ₽100           | ₽200           |

## Utilities (Means of Production)

Utilities cannot be collectivized. Their quota is based on the dice roll that brought the player to the space.

| Property                  | Cost | Mortgage | Rent (1 owned) | Rent (2 owned) |
|---------------------------|------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| State Electricity Board   | ₽150 | ₽75      | 4 × dice roll  | 10 × dice roll |
| People's Water Collective | ₽150 | ₽75      | 4 × dice roll  | 10 × dice roll |

**Important**: Only COMMISSAR rank or higher may own utilities.

## Property Special Abilities

Many properties grant special abilities when owned. For details on property abilities, see the [complete rules](communistopoly-rules.md#property-special-abilities).

Examples include:

- **Siberian Work Camps** (both): Send one player to Gulag per game (Stalin must approve)
- **Government Ministries** (all three): Rewrite one rule per game (Stalin has veto power)
- **Lenin's Mausoleum**: Immunity to denouncement while custodian

---

## Quick Tips

- **Group Ownership**: Owning all properties in a group doubles the base rent before any collectivization
- **Collectivization Strategy**: The jump from ★★☆☆☆ to ★★★☆☆ is significant (9× to 15×)
- **Railways vs Properties**: Railways can be profitable early game without improvements
- **Utilities**: Risky investment, but powerful if you roll high dice totals
- **Kremlin Properties**: Most expensive but highest returns - require significant investment
