# Communistopoly

A satirical digital board game that transforms Monopoly's capitalist fantasy into a darkly comedic simulation of Soviet bureaucracy, paranoia, and ideological absurdity.

**"All players are equal, but some players are more equal than others."**

## Overview

Communistopoly is a shared-screen/hot-seat digital board game for 3-6 players, where one player takes on the role of "Stalin" (the game master) and controls the fate of all other comrades. Victory is not achieved through wealth accumulation—it is survived through political manoeuvring, strategic betrayal, and shameless flattery of Comrade Stalin.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, featuring authentic Soviet-era visual design inspired by Constructivist propaganda art.

## Current Status: Fully Playable Game ✓

**Communistopoly is now a complete, fully playable board game!** All core mechanics, special features, and victory conditions have been implemented. The game is ready for 3-6 players with one acting as Stalin.
