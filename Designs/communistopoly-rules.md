# COMMUNISTOPOLY
## A Satirical House-Rules Variant of Monopoly
### *"All players are equal, but some players are more equal than others."*

---

# OVERVIEW

Communistopoly transforms the capitalist fantasy of Monopoly into a darkly comedic simulation of Soviet bureaucracy, paranoia, and ideological absurdity. Victory is not achieved through wealth accumulation—it is survived through political maneuvering, strategic betrayal, and shameless flattery of Comrade Stalin (the Banker).

**Players:** 3-6 (One must be Stalin)

**Win Condition:** Be the last player not in the Gulag or executed. There are no winners in communism—only survivors.

---

# SETUP

## Selecting Stalin

Before the game begins, players must select who will be Stalin. This can be done by:
- The owner of the game automatically becomes Stalin (they bought it, after all—very capitalist of them)
- Democratic vote (the communist way, where Stalin counts the votes)
- Whoever has the best mustache

**Stalin does not play as a regular player.** Stalin is the Banker, the Judge, the Party, and the State. Stalin sits at the head of the table and controls the game.

## Starting Conditions

- All players begin with **1,500 Rubles** (use Monopoly money but call it Rubles)
- All players begin at **Party Rank: Proletariat** (the lowest rank)
- All properties begin owned by **THE STATE** (the bank)
- Place all property cards face-up near Stalin—these are State Assets

# THE BOARD: RENAMED SPACES

## Corner Spaces

| Original     | Communistopoly               | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GO           | **STOY (СТОЙ)** "Checkpoint" | **Passing:** Pay 200₽ "travel tax" to the State. **Landing exactly:** You may attempt to pilfer—roll one die. On 4-6, steal 100₽ from the State coffers. On 1-3, you are caught and sent directly to the Gulag. |
| Jail         | **THE GULAG**                | See Gulag Rules below                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Free Parking | **BREADLINE**                | All players must give you one item (50₽, a property, or a favor owed). If any player refuses, you may denounce them. Stalin adjudicates.                                                                        |
| Go To Jail   | **ENEMY OF THE STATE**       | Go directly to the Gulag. Do not pass Stoy. Do not collect anything. Lose one Party Rank.                                                                                                                       |

## Property Groups

Properties cannot be "owned" in the capitalist sense. Instead, players become **Custodians** of State property, responsible for its maintenance and collectivization. Rent is replaced with **Productivity Quotas**—failure to meet them reflects poorly on YOU.

### Green → PARTY ELITE DISTRICT

*Special Rule: Only INNER CIRCLE rank may become Custodian. Custodian of Stalin's Private Office may whisper privately with Stalin once per round. Custodian of Lenin's Mausoleum is immune to ONE denouncement per game (Lenin protects you from beyond the grave).*

## Railroads → TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY STATIONS

| Original              | Communistopoly          | Function                   |

| Short Line            | **Vladivostok Station** | 200₽ for all 4 stations    |

*Special Rule: Controller of all four stations may transport any player directly to the Gulag once per game, claiming they were "attempting to flee the motherland."*

## Utilities → THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION

| Original         | Communistopoly                | Function  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Electric Company | **State Electricity Board**   | See below |
| Water Works      | **People's Water Collective** | See below |

**CRITICAL RULE:** The Means of Production may ONLY be controlled by players of rank **COMMISSAR** or higher. Any lower-ranked player who lands here and could afford custodianship must instead donate the cost to the State "for the good of the people."

*Payment:* If one utility controlled: 4× dice roll. If both: 10× dice roll.

*Secret Rule (Stalin knows this):* If a Proletariat somehow obtains a utility (through a rule contradiction or Stalin's whim), all other players must denounce them within one round or face suspicion themselves.

## Tax Spaces

| Original   | Communistopoly                 | Function                                                                                                                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Income Tax | **REVOLUTIONARY CONTRIBUTION** | Pay 15% of total wealth OR 200₽ (player's choice). Then Stalin may audit you—if you chose the lower amount, pay the difference plus 50₽ penalty. |
| Luxury Tax | **BOURGEOIS DECADENCE TAX**    | Pay 100₽. If you are the wealthiest player, pay 200₽ and lose one Party Rank for "capitalist tendencies."                                        |

## Chance → PARTY DIRECTIVE

When you land on Party Directive, Stalin draws a card and reads it aloud. These are direct orders from the Party and must be obeyed.

## Community Chest → COMMUNIST TEST

When you land on Communist Test, another player (chosen by Stalin) asks you a trivia question from the Communist Test card deck. See Communist Test section below.

---

# PARTY RANK SYSTEM

All players have a Party Rank that determines their privileges and vulnerability. Ranks from lowest to highest:

## 1. PROLETARIAT (Starting Rank)
- Cannot control utilities
- Cannot control Green or Dark Blue properties
- Pay full price for everything
- Most vulnerable to denouncement
- *"You are the backbone of the revolution, comrade. Now break your back."*

## 2. PARTY MEMBER
- May control Green properties
- 10% discount on all State purchases
- May vote on denouncements
- *"You have proven your loyalty. For now."*

**To achieve:** Successfully answer 2 Communist Test questions OR denounce a player who is found guilty OR bribe Stalin (minimum 300₽, Stalin's discretion)

## 3. COMMISSAR
- May control utilities (Means of Production)
- 20% discount on all State purchases
- May call ONE emergency Party meeting per game (pause game to discuss "state matters")

**To achieve:** Control 3+ properties AND successfully answer 1 Hard Communist Test question OR be personally promoted by Stalin

## 4. INNER CIRCLE
- May control Dark Blue properties
- 50% discount on all State purchases
- May veto ONE denouncement per game
- May privately consult with Stalin
- Denouncements against you require unanimous player agreement AND Stalin's approval
- *"You sit at the right hand of the Father of Nations."*

**To achieve:** Control 5+ properties AND be nominated by Stalin AND survive a "loyalty test" (other players vote; majority must approve OR you go to Gulag)

## LOSING RANK

You lose one rank when:
- Sent to the Gulag
- Found guilty of a denouncement
- Fail 2 Communist Tests in a row
- Stalin decrees it (must provide theatrical justification)

---

# THE GULAG

The Gulag is not mere jail. It is a crucible of suffering from which few return.

## Entering the Gulag
You are sent to the Gulag when:
- You land on "Enemy of the State"
- You are denounced and found guilty
- You fail to pay a debt within one full round
- You roll three doubles (counter-revolutionary behavior)
- Stalin sends you (requires justification, however flimsy)

## Escaping the Gulag

**Option 1: Serve Your Sentence**
- Roll dice at the start of each turn
- You need DOUBLES to escape
- BUT: On your 1st turn, you need double 6s
- On your 2nd turn, double 5s or 6s
- On your 3rd turn, double 4, 5, or 6s
- On your 4th turn, double 3, 4, 5, or 6s
- On your 5th+ turn, any doubles

**Option 2: Rehabilitation Through Labor**
- Pay 500₽ to the State (your "rehabilitation fee")
- You are released but lose one Party Rank

**Option 3: Someone Vouches For You**
- Another player may vouch for your release
- If they do, you are released immediately
- BUT: If you commit ANY offense in the next 3 rounds, your voucher goes to the Gulag too
- The voucher may not refuse this arrangement once offered

**Option 4: Inform on Another Player**
- Name another player and accuse them of a crime (real or invented)
- Stalin holds a tribunal (see Denouncement rules)
- If they are found guilty, you swap places
- If they are found innocent, add 2 turns to your sentence

**Option 5: Bribe the Guards**
- Pay Stalin directly (minimum 200₽, negotiable)
- Stalin may accept or reject for any reason
- If rejected, you lose the money anyway ("confiscated contraband")

---

# DENOUNCEMENT SYSTEM

Denouncing other players is the heart of Communistopoly. It is how you survive.

## Making a Denouncement

Any player may denounce any other player at any time by declaring:

*"I denounce [Player Name] for [Crime]!"*

Crimes include (but are not limited to):
- Counter-revolutionary activities
- Capitalist sympathies
- Hoarding resources
- Insufficient enthusiasm
- Suspicious behavior
- Being too successful
- Being too unsuccessful
- Having a suspicious look
- Not having a suspicious enough look
- "You know what you did"

## The Tribunal

1. **Stalin presides** as judge
2. **The Accuser** presents their case (30 seconds max)
3. **The Accused** defends themselves (30 seconds max)
4. **Witnesses** may speak for either side (15 seconds each)
5. **Stalin renders judgment**

Stalin's judgment options:
- **GUILTY:** Accused goes to Gulag, loses one Rank, Accuser gains 100₽ "informant bonus"
- **INNOCENT:** Accuser loses one Rank for "wasting the Party's time"
- **BOTH GUILTY:** Both go to Gulag (Stalin loves this option)
- **INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:** No punishment, but accused is now "under suspicion" (next denouncement against them requires no witnesses)

## Denouncement Limits

- You may only denounce once per round (unless you are COMMISSAR or higher)
- You cannot denounce someone already in the Gulag
- You cannot denounce Stalin (this is itself a crime; go directly to Gulag)

# PLAYING PIECES & SPECIAL ABILITIES

Each player selects a piece with unique abilities. Stalin assigns pieces to prevent arguments (arguing is counter-revolutionary).

## THE HAMMER
*"The worker's tool, building the future"*
- +50₽ every time you pass Stoy (offset the tax)
- Cannot be sent to Gulag by other players (only by Stalin or landing on Enemy of the State)
- Must always vote "guilty" in tribunals or lose ability for rest of game

## THE SICKLE
*"The farmer's blade, reaping the harvest"*
- Collective Farm quotas against you are halved
- Once per game, may "harvest" another player's property (steal custodianship of one property worth less than 150₽)
- Must announce "For the Motherland!" before each roll or pay 25₽ fine

## THE RED STAR
*"Shining beacon of the revolution"*
- Start at Party Member rank instead of Proletariat
- All Communist Test penalties against you are doubled
- If you ever fall to Proletariat rank, you are immediately executed (eliminated from game)

## THE TANK
*"The iron fist of the Red Army"*
- May "requisition" 50₽ from any player you pass (once per lap around the board)
- Immune to first Gulag sentence (return to nearest Railway Station instead)
- Cannot control any properties in the Collective Farm group

## THE BREAD LOAF
*"The people's sustenance... when available"*
- Whenever another player cannot pay a debt, you may pay it for them (they now owe YOU, not the state—interest accrues at 20% per round)
- If you ever have less than 100₽, you are "starving" and must beg other players or Stalin each turn
- May never have more than 1,000₽ (excess must be "donated" to the State)

## THE IRON CURTAIN (Thimble replacement)
*"What happens in the USSR stays in the USSR"*
- Other players cannot see your money (keep it hidden)
- Stalin may audit you at any time; if you have more than you've claimed, Gulag
- Once per game, may "disappear" a player's property card (shuffle it back into State ownership)

## THE VODKA BOTTLE
*"The true opiate of the masses"*
- Before any roll, may "drink" to roll 3 dice and choose 2
- Every time you use this ability, your speech must be slightly more slurred
- If Stalin judges you "too sober," you must drink (in real life, water is acceptable) or lose the ability
- Immune to trick questions (too drunk to be held accountable)

## THE STATUE OF LENIN
*"The eternal revolutionary, watching over us all"*
- Cannot be denounced by players of lower rank
- Once per game, may give an "inspiring speech" (30 seconds) to gain 100₽ from each player who applauds (Stalin judges sincerity of applause)
- Must remain standing whenever Lenin is mentioned, or lose 50₽

---

# STALIN'S POWERS

The player who is Stalin has absolute authority, limited only by the need to maintain the illusion of fairness (barely).

## Absolute Powers (No justification needed)
- Set prices for State property sales (within 50-200% of printed value)
- Decide outcomes of denouncement tribunals
- Call for "voluntary donations" to the State (players may refuse at their own risk)
- Assign Communist Test questions to specific players
- Promote players (but not demote without cause)

## Powers Requiring Theatrical Justification
- Send a player to the Gulag
- Confiscate a player's property
- Execute a player (eliminate them from the game)
- Change a rule mid-game
- Declare a player "Hero of the Soviet Union" (immune to all negative effects for 3 rounds)

## Powers Stalin Does NOT Have
- Stalin cannot play as a regular player
- Stalin cannot take money for personal use (the State is not Stalin's personal bank... officially)
- Stalin cannot win or lose—Stalin is eternal

## Bribing Stalin

Players may attempt to bribe Stalin at any time. Bribes may be:
- Money (slides across the table discreetly)
- Flattery (genuinely creative compliments)
- Favors (promises of future support)
- Actual snacks/drinks (highly effective)

Stalin may accept or reject bribes without explanation. Rejected bribes are confiscated by the State.

---

# PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT: "COLLECTIVIZATION"

Instead of houses and hotels, properties are improved through Collectivization.

## Levels of Collectivization

1. **Worker's Committee** (House equivalent): +50% to quota. Cost: 100₽
2. **Party Oversight** (2 houses): +100% to quota. Cost: 100₽
3. **Full Collectivization** (3 houses): +150% to quota. Cost: 100₽
4. **Model Soviet** (4 houses): +200% to quota. Cost: 100₽
5. **People's Palace** (Hotel): +300% to quota, other players must salute when landing. Cost: 200₽

## Improvement Rules

- Must improve evenly across color groups (communist equality)
- Improvements can be "requisitioned" by Stalin at any time for State needs
- If you cannot pay a debt, your improvements are liquidated first

---

# GAME END CONDITIONS

## Individual Elimination

A player is eliminated when:
- They cannot pay a debt and have no assets to liquidate
- They are executed by Stalin (requires serious "crime" or unanimous player vote + Stalin approval)
- They spend 10 consecutive turns in the Gulag
- Their piece ability causes elimination (Red Star falling to Proletariat)

Eliminated players become **Ghosts of the Revolution:**
- They may still speak and influence the game
- They may advise Stalin (who may ignore them)
- They cannot vote, roll, or own anything
- They should occasionally moan about their fate

## Game Victory

The game ends when:
- Only one player remains (SURVIVOR VICTORY)
- All players are eliminated (STALIN VICTORY—the State wins)
- Players unanimously agree to end the game (REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT—everyone was too drunk/tired to continue)
- 3+ hours have passed (STALEMATE—the Five-Year Plan extends indefinitely)

In case of Survivor Victory, the winner does not celebrate. The winner simply survives. In the Soviet Union, survival is victory enough.

---

# OPTIONAL RULES FOR MAXIMUM CHAOS

## The Secret Police
At game start, Stalin secretly designates one player as the "KGB Informant." This player:
- Reports all private conversations to Stalin
- Receives 50₽ for each successful denouncement they originate
- Is revealed if they are ever sent to the Gulag (they lose all powers and benefits)

## Five-Year Plans
Every 30 minutes of real time, Stalin announces a "Five-Year Plan" with specific quotas:
- "The State requires 1,000₽ from the collective within 10 minutes"
- If met: All players receive 50₽ bonus
- If not met: The poorest player goes to Gulag for "sabotage"

## The Great Purge
Once per game, Stalin may declare "The Great Purge":
- All players must simultaneously point at another player
- The player with the most fingers pointed at them goes to Gulag
- In case of tie, both go
- Stalin breaks ties if necessary

## Rehabilitation
Players in the Gulag may write "confessions" (actual written notes) admitting to crimes. Stalin reads these aloud and may reduce sentences for sufficiently creative/groveling confessions.

## The Personality Cult
Players may construct a "shrine to Stalin" using game pieces, snacks, or other items. Stalin may reward creativity with Rubles or rank promotions. This is not mandatory, but refusal may be noted.
